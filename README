This software changes the background of your Gnome desktop.

The application has two scripts, one for changing the background from a set of wallpapers, and the other one from wallpapers
downloaded from art.gnome.org, so you do not have to provide backgrounds.

Please, read the INSTALL file for installation and set up instructions.
