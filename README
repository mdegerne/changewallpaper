Now you have a .wallpaperrc file that has the options for cambiar2.py. In this file you set the resolution and the type of wallpaper that you want. art.gnome.org tags the wallpapers with: GNOME, ABSTRACT, NATURE and OTHER. If you want only that wallpapers, you set the option to that tags, and if you want all the wallpapers, you use ALL.
