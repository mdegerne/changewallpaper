INSTALL

To install changewallpaper you only have to unzip or untar the package in a folder called Wallpapers of your home directory.
Thus, first create a folder in your home directory called Wallpapers, and then untar the package. After that you should have 
two scripts: change-background-folder.py and change-background-art-gnome.py. 

$ cd
$ mkdir Wallpapers
$ unzip changewallpaper.zip

The modus operandi of these scripts is simple. For both of them, the script has an input list of backgrounds (backgrounds
that you have previously downloaded in a folder, or a remote list automagically created from art.gnome.org). The list is used
for changing the wallpapers and not repeat them after a change. The list works like a FIFO: first in first out, so once a
background is used, it is removed from the list. The scripts create a softlink to the chosen wallpaper. This softlink is
called wallpaper, and is the file that have to be chosen from the Gnome dekstop wallpaper application. Thanks to this
approach, the name of the file never changes (it is called always wallpaper) but it will point to a different background each
time one of the scripts are run.

In order to change the wallpaper, you have to run one of the scripts manually, but if you use cron, you will be able to do it
automatically for you. Thanks to cron, you can change the wallpaper on any possible schedule (please, read the cron
documentation).

=====================================
USING change-background-folder.py
=====================================

This script changes the background of your desktop by using a set of existing backgrounds in a specific folder, the
same folder where it is stored the script and it is called: Wallpapers. Thus, you should have something like this:

/home/user/Wallpapers
+---------->change-background-folder.py
+---------->Background01.jpg
+---------->Background02.png
+---------->....
+---------->BacgroundNN.png

Run the script: ./change-background-folder.py and in the folder it will be created a softlink called Wallpaper that should
point to one of your backgrounds:

$ ./change-background-folder.py
$ ls -l Wallpaper
  Wallpaper -> /home/user/Wallpapers/Background02.png

Now, click on System->Preferences->Appearance, click on the tab Background, click on the Add button and choose the file
/home/user/Wallpapers/Wallpaper as the background.

Finally, we only have to set up cron to automatically change the wallpaper for us:

$ crontab -e
@reboot /home/user/Wallpapers/./change-background-folder.py

This will change the wallpaper each time we power on the computer.

It is done!!


=====================================
USING change-background-art-gnome.py
=====================================

This second script basically does the same as the previous one, but the difference is that the wallpapers are downloaded from
the web http://art.gnome.org. In this site, you can find a lot of different wallpapers that can be used for you Gnome
desktop. 

This script has a config file: .wallpaperrc where you can specify the type of backgrounds that you want to have (GNOME,
ABSTRACT, NATURE and OTHER). Additionally, you can also select the resolution that you want, so all the downloaded wallpapers
will fit correctly in your screen. Thus, the config file has the following options:

resolution=1024x768

type=NATURE

In resolution you have to write the resolution of your screen, and in type you can write GNOME, ABSTRACT, NATURE, OTHER or
ALL. If you write ALL, all the types of backgrounds can be downloaded and use as background for your desktop (have a look at
art.gnome.org for choosing a type).

By default, the package provides a default config file for the script with a resolution of 1024x768 and background
type=NATURE.

Both files, .wallpaperrc and change-background-art-gnome.py should be stored on a folder called Wallpapers. Thus, you should
create it if you have not done yet, and put inside both files. After that, you only will need an Internet connection to allow
the script to download the backgrounds from art.gnome.org. 

Finally, you have to setup cron to automatically change your wallpaper:

$ crontab -e
@reboot /home/user/Wallpapers/./change-background-art-gnome.py

However this will only work if your computer is connected via a wire, because if you are using a wifi connection, the network
in Gnome is only established after you have logged in. Thus, it will not work. The solution is to add the script to the
Session Preferences under the auto-start section with a delay, in order to allow the computer to establish the wifi
connection.

That's it. Thanks for downloading this software and if you have a problem or some comments, please, send me an e-mail:
